Kra-Merica Employee Submission Portal

# Overview

This project was designed to be a fun homage to the 90's sitcom Seinfeld. The client-side of the project used class components to build out the layout of what the user would see on the browser. The client side implemented Reactstrap as the styling library. 

A user is able to create, read, update, and delete posts that they make. They can also add comments to posts of which they can read, update, and delete.
